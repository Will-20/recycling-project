# EcoPal

An easy to use mobile-based recycling assistant. Simply scan a barcode to get all of the recycling advice you need.

Based your location, it provides nearby recycling centres, the specific recycling guidelines for your local region. It also helps you to gauge your C02 footprint, providing helpful, graphical comparisons to everyday activities. 

Users can help improve the app by adding any unregistered product to the database, increasing the recycling power for the entire database.
